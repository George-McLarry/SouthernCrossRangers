                As some of you may know, I have a passion for real country music. For those who are curious about how I got into it in the first place ~ The simple answer is "I don't know". I can't remember exactly what first got me into it, but I do know that I have been listening to country music since before I knew that different genres were a thing. There was always something special about it for me. and now more than ever, country music continues to touch my heart! My goal is to help bring back real country music - songs for entertainment, for families, for the "little man" and for God! So Thank you for being part of my journey. Let's grow together, it's an exciting road!
